# bulk_mail_sender_system
A bulk mail sender system in Python uses the Google Sheets API to fetch recipient details from a Google Sheet and the smtplib library to send customized emails to each recipient. This automation streamlines the process of sending bulk emails efficiently.

## Components and Workflow
### Google Sheet for Data Storage:

Data Entry: A Google Sheet is used to store employee performance data. Each row in the sheet represents an individual employee, and columns include various performance metrics, employee contact information, and target values.
Example Columns: Employee ID, Name, Email, Sales Target, Actual Sales, Customer Satisfaction Target, Actual Customer Satisfaction, etc.

### Data Retrieval:
Google Sheets API: The system uses the Google Sheets API to access and read data from the Google Sheet. This allows the script to programmatically retrieve the latest performance data.

### Data Processing and Analysis:
Discrepancy Identification: 
The system compares the actual performance metrics against the predefined targets. If discrepancies are found (i.e., if the actual performance is below the target), the employee is flagged for a warning email.
Example Logic: If Actual Sales < Sales Target or Actual Customer Satisfaction < Customer Satisfaction Target, the employee is marked as underperforming.

### Email Generation:

Personalization: The script generates personalized emails for each flagged employee. The content of the email includes the employee's name, the specific metrics they did not meet, and a message about the importance of meeting performance targets.
Email Template: A pre-defined email template is used, with placeholders for dynamic content such as employee name and specific performance details.

### Email Sending:
Email API: The system uses an email API (such as Gmail API or a service like SendGrid) to send the generated emails automatically.
Sending Mechanism: The script iterates over the list of flagged employees, fills in the email template with personalized details, and sends the email to the respective employeeâ€™s email address.
